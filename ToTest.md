# ToTest

- [ ] Verify tag menus still list active tags correctly for columns and tasks, including custom groups and active-tag overrides.
- [ ] Toggle the debug button (version menu) and confirm regular logs stop when debug is disabled while `WebviewBridge` warnings and errors still appear in the console when debug mode is on.
- [ ] Verify task menu actions still execute (move top/up/down/bottom, move to column list, and sort options).
- [ ] Verify video/audio embeds resolve multiple <source> tags correctly (relative, absolute, include-based paths) and keep the path menu overlay.
- [ ] Verify image/PDF/diagram placeholders still render and resolve paths in includes and main files.
- [ ] Open the search panel and export options to confirm hidden sections toggle visible as expected.
- [ ] Close the kanban panel (or switch files) several times and confirm no "Unbound disposable context" errors appear in the extension host logs, indicating FileRegistryChangeHandler disposes cleanly.
- [x] Start dragging a task, press Esc (or cancel drag), and confirm it snaps back with no stuck drag state.
- [ ] Drag a task outside the board and re-enter to confirm drop indicators recover (no stuck "left view" state). -> this FAILS
- [ ] Drag clipboard/empty/diagram cards onto the board and confirm indicators show and drag state resets (no lingering drag highlights).
- [ ] Drag internal columns/tasks and confirm external file drop indicators do not appear.
- [ ] Drag a task within the board and confirm external file handling stays inactive.
- [ ] Drag external files over the board, drop to create cards, then leave or drop outside; confirm indicators and highlights clear.
- [ ] Drag template/empty/clipboard columns onto the board and confirm drop zones, creation, and drag cleanup behave normally.
- [ ] Drop external files or clipboard cards and confirm tasks are created without console errors about drop feedback cleanup.
- [ ] Verify column headers are rendered through markdown-it so markup (e.g., `## Title`) displays as rich text and include badges still appear instead of raw markdown.
- [ ] Drag a diagram card (Excalidraw/Draw.io) and confirm the filename prompt is centered, validates invalid characters, and creates the task after confirmation.
- [x] Trigger the file search modal (broken link flow) and confirm it opens/closes without console errors.
- [x] Open the diagram filename prompt and confirm it is at least 200px wide and centered.
- [x] Open the diagram filename prompt and confirm the input field spans the modal width.
- [ ] Reorder a column within the same row and confirm the column order updates without losing any columns.
- [ ] Move a column between rows and confirm the #row tag updates correctly in the column title.
- [ ] Insert an empty column before/after another column and confirm #row/#stack tags match the target row/stack.
- [ ] Run a text search with HTML-like characters in titles/descriptions and confirm the search panel renders results without broken markup.
- [ ] Open the file search modal with a path containing special characters (&, <, >, quotes) and confirm it renders safely.
- [ ] Drag a column and confirm before/between/after drop zones appear and accept the drop.
- [ ] Open the extension settings and confirm remaining options are grouped by how often a user would change them (frequent first, advanced last).
- [ ] Toggle the new Marp settings visibility option in the file bar menu and verify the global Marp burger plus column/task Marp submenu items hide/show accordingly, confirm the document-level preference stays sticky (reopen or switch back to the board) via the new `setFilePreference` storage, and ensure no `setPreference` errors appear in the console.
- [ ] Adjust the font size control from the file bar menu (or settings) so the board text scales, confirm the preference is stored under `markdown-kanban.fontSize`, and check the console for the absence of `setPreference` errors when switching values.
- [ ] Open any burger menu (e.g., task or column actions) and confirm the dropdown uses the configured minimum width (≈200px) so items do not overflow, then open a submenu and verify the repositioned panel stays within the screen bounds.
- [ ] Verify the submenu's arrow and surrounding area stay totally within the dropdown background so there are no floating pointers or clipped highlights.
- [ ] Toggle the new Show special characters option in the file bar menu and confirm spaces, tabs, newline, and carriage return indicators appear and disappear on task titles and descriptions.
- [ ] While editing a task title or description, press Shift+Tab from a mid-line cursor and confirm it removes a tab or two spaces at the cursor position (not just at the line start).
- [ ] With the special characters toggle enabled, confirm no markers are visible while viewing tasks normally, and that they appear only after entering edit mode (then disappear again when editing ends).
- [ ] Enable the show-special-characters toggle while editing and verify the glyph overlay is limited to the currently active editor, not leaking onto other display-only text fields or other editors.
- [ ] With show-special-characters enabled, make sure the caret stays aligned with the visible characters/mapping glyphs (any padding/font differences should be copied from the edit field).
- [ ] Select text, press *, _, ~, [, (, or { and confirm the editor adds the matching start/end characters around the selection while keeping it highlighted; with no selection the keys should just insert their character.
