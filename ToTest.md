# ToTest

- [ ] Verify tag menus still list active tags correctly for columns and tasks, including custom groups and active-tag overrides.
- [ ] Verify task menu actions still execute (move top/up/down/bottom, move to column list, and sort options).
- [ ] Verify video/audio embeds resolve multiple <source> tags correctly (relative, absolute, include-based paths) and keep the path menu overlay.
- [ ] Verify image/PDF/diagram placeholders still render and resolve paths in includes and main files.
- [ ] Open the search panel and export options to confirm hidden sections toggle visible as expected.
- [ ] Start dragging a task, press Esc (or cancel drag), and confirm it snaps back with no stuck drag state.
- [ ] Drag a task outside the board and re-enter to confirm drop indicators recover (no stuck "left view" state).
- [ ] Drag clipboard/empty/diagram cards onto the board and confirm indicators show and drag state resets (no lingering drag highlights).
- [ ] Drag internal columns/tasks and confirm external file drop indicators do not appear.
- [ ] Drag a task within the board and confirm external file handling stays inactive.
- [ ] Drag external files over the board, drop to create cards, then leave or drop outside; confirm indicators and highlights clear.
- [ ] Drag template/empty/clipboard columns onto the board and confirm drop zones, creation, and drag cleanup behave normally.
- [ ] Drop external files or clipboard cards and confirm tasks are created without console errors about drop feedback cleanup.
