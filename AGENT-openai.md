- Check in your changes after editing the code with a comment what has been fixed, or whats been worked on.
- Test your changes after each major step by building.
- increase the revision version number after each change.
- after each major (introducing multiple new features or changing the interface more then just a layout or smaller change) then change change the minor version number and create a build by using the ./build.sh script!
