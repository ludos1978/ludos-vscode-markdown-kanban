- plan high-level cleanups. for this update the files in the agent folder first. then analyze the structure of the code. then analyze wether we could reasonably apply design patterns to optimize it and reduce changes of errors.
- analyze how we could incorporate the https://github.com/plantuml/plantuml.js rendering engine into the markdown renderer. but i want the use the normal code render syntax ```plantuml ... ``` instead of @startuml as it's by default in this addon if that can be done without modifying the plantuml.js code . 
  - also plan a feature to convert the planuml to a svg, create a button next to the rendered plantuml diagram. when pressed the plantuml code is commented out and the svg image is embedded using the image url ![]() . place the image into a Media-{markdown-filename} folder.
